Synergy is an extremely modular game engine written in Rust. This repository contains its core components, so it's basically an implementation the ECS pattern along with some common utilities. It is meant to be really modular, so you can add your own systems and components to it, or even use it as a base for your own engine.


## Very Early WIP

As for now, the core is an early work in progress, and is going through a complete rewrite, so I'm afraid there's no public code yet, but stay tuned!


## Getting Started

*Coming soon!*


## Why Rust?

* **Top performance** so your most demanding creations will run smoothly even on a toaster (kinda).
* **Memory safety** so your games donâ€™t abruptly crash for an untraceable reason.
* **Rust is just cool.**


## Contributing

*Coming soon!*
